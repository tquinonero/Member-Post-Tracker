# Member-Post-Tracker

WordPress plugin that allows users to mark posts as read. To do so, it displays a button with the text "Mark as Read" in the Frontend. When clicked, this buttton updates user_meta to save the post as "Read" and updates the text in the button to "Read".
This is a very simple plugin I created for my own personal and commercial use, and then decided to release it under the GPL license umbrella. A copy of the license is distributed with this software. If you modify the software, you must also include the license as is in this release. You must not delete this notice, and you must give credit to its original author for the original code.
Although I do my best to ensure the security of my software, remember this is open source software and is distributed without any warranty. To summarise: you cannot sue me for using this plugin or any damage that may result from using it. Use at your own risk.

Update: added plugin settings page, support for CPT defined by the user in plugin settings page, and support for custom icons defined in the same page.
