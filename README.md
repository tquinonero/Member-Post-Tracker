# Member-Post-Tracker

WordPress plugin that allows users to mark posts as read. To do so, it displays a button with the text "Mark as Read" in the Frontend. When clicked, this buttton updates user_meta to save the post as "Read" and updates the text in the button to "Read".
This is a very simple plugin I created for my own personal use, and decided to release it under the GPL license umbrella. A copy of the license is distributed with this software. If you modify the software, you must also include the license as is in this release. You must not delete this notice, and you must give credit to its original author for the original code.
